AI-Powered Social Media Automation WorkflowThis repository contains an advanced automation workflow built with n8n that streamlines the entire process of content creation and publishing across multiple social media platforms.The workflow is designed to be triggered by a simple data entry in a Google Sheet, which then kicks off a powerful pipeline involving AI content generation and multi-platform distribution.(Note: You can take a screenshot of your n8n canvas and upload it to a site like Imgur to get a link for this image.)How It Works: The Automated PipelineThis workflow is built on a simple yet powerful trigger-and-action model:Trigger: The entire process starts when a new row containing a link to an article is added to a specific Google Sheet.AI Content Generation: The workflow takes the article link and sends it to an LLM (Large Language Model) via an API. The AI is prompted to:Read the article.Generate a concise, eye-catching title.Create a bullet-point summary.Write unique, platform-specific captions (e.g., professional for LinkedIn, casual for Facebook).Generate a list of relevant hashtags.Multi-Platform Publishing: Once the content is generated, the workflow automatically posts it to a suite of social media channels, including:LinkedInFacebookInstagramWhatsAppX (formerly Twitter)Technologies & Skills ShowcasedThis project demonstrates proficiency in a range of modern automation and integration skills:Workflow Automation: Deep understanding of building complex, multi-step workflows using n8n.API Integration: Seamlessly connecting to and manipulating data from various third-party REST APIs (Google Sheets, LLMs, and all social media platforms).AI & LLMs: Practical experience in prompting and integrating Large Language Models for automated content creation.Data Handling: Parsing and transforming JSON data between different steps and services.Problem-Solving: Designing an efficient, end-to-end solution to automate a repetitive and time-consuming task.How to Use This WorkflowTo set up this workflow in your own n8n instance, you will need to:Import the Workflow: Import the social-media-workflow.json file into your n8n canvas.Configure Credentials: You will need to create and add your own API credentials for the following services within n8n:Google Sheets (OAuth)Your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI)All social media platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook Developer, etc.)Update Node Parameters: Go through each node and update any hardcoded IDs (like the Google Sheet ID) or parameters to match your own setup.Activate the Workflow: Once configured, set the workflow to "Active" and it will start listening for the Google Sheets trigger.
